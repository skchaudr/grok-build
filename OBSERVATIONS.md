# Observations

## 2026-10-02 Task A

- `profiles/acp-enhanced` reads `DSH_ACP_PROVIDER` / `DSH_ACP_MODEL`, but its dumped config does not register a `cliproxy` provider (no base URL). The `:8317` provider block lives on the `web`, `acp`, `tui`, `headless`, and `pi-host` patches, not on `acp-enhanced`. The matrix still sets the env vars the brief names (`cliproxy` / `grok-4.7`).
- An in-flight `cargo build --release -p xai-grok-pager-bin` was already running in `/home/sab-mini/repos/grok-build` (the dirty main checkout). `acp/mod.rs` there differs from this worktree. That binary is not a clean `b6a12331` build. This task will rebuild from the worktree into the shared target dir after that cargo exits.
- Leftover drafts `acp-matrix.leftover.sh` and `docs-acp-matrix.leftover.md` were read and deleted.
- The shell already exports `PAGER=less`. The matrix script uses `ACP_PAGER` so it does not launch `less` as the pager binary.
